  Welcome to My Home Page

A bit about Andy McLennan:

  *

    After almost two decades in the Department of Economics <http://
    www.econ.umn.edu/> of the University of Minnesota <http://
    www.umn.edu/>, and a brief appointment at the University of Sydney,
    I've been a professor at the School of Economics of the University
    of Queensland since 2007. My research specializations are
    mathematical economics and game theory. Among other things, I have
    been interested in computational issues arising out of the problem
    of getting a computer to find all Nash equilibria of a finite game,
    which has led me to learn about literature in algebraic geometry
    related to the solution of systems of polynomial equations.

  *

    Along with the late Richard McKelvey, I was able to apply the ideas
    there to characterize both the largest number of totally mixed Nash
    equilibria a "generic" normal form game might have, and the average
    number. For several years I worked with Richard McKelvey, Ted
    Turocy, and others, on Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory
    <http://www.gambit-project.org/>, which is a free software package
    for dealing with finite games in normal and extensive form.

  *

    Random stumbling around has led me into a variety of other projects,
    and you can see by checking out recent papers <https://
    andymclennan.droppages.com/Papers/papers.html>. One exciting
    development is a very simple proof of Kakutani's fixed point theorem
    that Rabee Tourky and I came up with. I also like pure mathematics.
    For those who like "Book" proofs, let me recommend the note on the
    Erdos-Sos conjecture. (You won't learn any economics, but you should
    be able to read it even if you don't know much about graph theory.)
    I have recently written a paper that provides a geometric analogue
    of the Vietoris-Begle theorem, and applies it to show that certain
    subsets of Riesz spaces are contractible. A couple expository papers
    explain (at different levels) modern versions of the Morse-Sard
    theorem, with a fairly easy proof. There is also a book that
    translates Serre's famous paper /Fascieux Algebrique Coherent/ and
    provides all required background from commutative algebra.

    For me macroeconomic research has always been a spectator sport, but
    that may be changing.
