<P>

<p>A bit about Andy McLennan:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>After almost two decades in the <a href=http://www.econ.umn.edu>Department of

Economics</a> of the

<a href=http://www.umn.edu>University of Minnesota</a>,

and a brief appointment at the University of Sydney,

I've been a professor at the School of Economics of the

University of Queensland since 2007.  My research specializations are

mathematical economics and game theory.  Among other things, I have been

interested in computational issues arising out of the problem

of getting a computer to find all Nash equilibria of a finite

game, which has led me to learn

about literature in algebraic geometry related to the

solution of systems of polynomial equations.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Along with the late

Richard McKelvey, I was

able to apply the ideas there to characterize

both the largest number of totally mixed Nash equilibria

a &quot;generic&quot; normal form game might

have, and the average number.

For several years I worked with Richard McKelvey,

Ted Turocy, and others, on <a href=http://www.gambit-project.org/>Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory</a>, which is

a free software package for dealing with finite games in normal and

extensive form.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Random stumbling around has led me into a variety of other projects,

and you can see by checking out <a href="Papers/papers.html">recent

papers</a>.  One exciting development is a very simple proof of

Kakutani's fixed point theorem that Rabee Tourky and I came up with.

I also like pure mathematics.  For those who like &quot;Book&quot; proofs, let

me recommend the note on the Erdos-Sos conjecture.  (You won't learn

any economics, but you should be able to read it even if you don't

know much about graph theory.)  I have recently written a paper that

provides a geometric analogue of the Vietoris-Begle theorem, and

applies it to show that certain subsets of Riesz spaces are

contractible. A couple expository papers explain (at different levels)

modern versions of the Morse-Sard theorem, with

a fairly easy proof.  There is also a book that translates Serre's famous

paper <i>Fascieux Algebrique Coherent</i> and provides all required

background from commutative algebra.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>For me macroeconomic research has always been a spectator sport, but that may be changing.</p>
